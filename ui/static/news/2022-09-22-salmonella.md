IslandCompare is now adding support to detect curated, known Salmonella enterica genomic islands. In the visualization you will see them listed as the "Curated Genomic Islands" predictor. Additionally, if you hover your mouse over the island, it will show the genomic island name detected. If you are analyzing Salmonella enterica genomes in IslandCompare and want to see curated GI predictions for your genomes, make sure that the "Organism" field in your submitted file is filled out and includes the text "Salmonella enterica".

A major update of the IslandCompare backend brings in a variety of new features to improve stability and handle larger volumes of traffic. These updates will be occurring around Sept 22-23, and you may experience intermittent connectivity issues.

If you have any questions or problems, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us at islandpick-mail@sfu.ca, and thank you for your understanding as we implement this update.
