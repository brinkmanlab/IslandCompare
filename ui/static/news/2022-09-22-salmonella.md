IslandCompare is now adding support to detect curated, known Salmonella Genomic Islands. In the visualization you will see them listed as the "Curated
Genomic Islands" predictor. Additionally, if you hover your mouse over the island, it will show the genomic island name detected.

A major update of the IslandCompare backend brings in a variety of new features to improve stability and handle larger volumes of traffic. These
updates will be occurring around Sept 22-23, and you may experience intermittent connectivity issues.

If you have any questions or problems, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us at islandpick-mail@sfu.ca, and thank you for your understanding as we
implement this update.
