Note there are known bugs we are working on: 

1. a refresh of the jobs page may be required to show a run is completed, and 
2. genomes not oriented to have the origin of replication at the start of the genome sequence may fail. 

We are working to resolve these shortly. Check back here for future software updates or see [contact information](/contact) to be added to the mailing list.
