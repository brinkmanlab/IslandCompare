## Submit jobs using a command line interface
If you prefer working in a command line environment or wish to automate the task of submitting jobs, we have produced a [command line interface script](https://github.com/brinkmanlab/islandcompare-cli) that aids in this.
The linked resource includes the `islandcompare.py` script and instructions on how to use it.

## Installing the IslandCompare workflow into an existing Galaxy instance
The workflow is awaiting publication and is not yet available. Please check back here after a publication is released for instructions on how to install your own copy of IslandCompare.
