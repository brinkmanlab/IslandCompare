IslandCompare enabled the identification of cases where GIs are predicted inconsistently across genomes

Illustrated is an example of a set of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates where a GI was missed in one genome (top) 
despite aligning to predicted GIs (blue) in other genomes

An evaluation of 40 P. aeruginosa genomes (analysed with IslandPath-DIMOB3) revealed that gene annotation 
differences and alternate pseudogene predictions were significantly more prevalent among pairs of aligned 
cross-genome sub-sequences when only one was predicted as a GI versus both
