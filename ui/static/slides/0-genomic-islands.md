Genomic islands (GIs) are clusters of genes of probable horizontal origin integrated into microbial 
chromosomes1 Medically important adaptations, including virulence factors and certain antimicrobial 
resistance genes, are disproportionately encoded on GIs2

**Problem:** Current computational methods for GI prediction are limited to the analysis of one or 
two genomes, while increasingly analysis of larger microbial population datasets is required
