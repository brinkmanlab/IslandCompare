IslandCompare analysis of Listeria monocytogenes isolates. GIs are highlighted on the 
genomes (linear white bar with alignment shown in grey), with clusters of GIs sharing 
the same colour. Zoom-in functionality is available for viewing sub-clades, genomic 
regions, and GI clusters (example at bottom). Predicted antimicrobial resistance genes 
are indicated by pink flags.
